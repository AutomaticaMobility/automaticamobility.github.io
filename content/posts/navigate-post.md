The solution to the green transport problem in shared spaces is an autonomous shared mobility service (Robotaxi) integrated as part of the public transport network. We plan to build a system capable of navigating dense pedestrian zones safely and efficiently by understanding pedestrian behaviour and deploying socially aware driving. This solution will be available for the transportation of goods and will be available to all users equally. We aim to develop technology and software to empower such a solution.
