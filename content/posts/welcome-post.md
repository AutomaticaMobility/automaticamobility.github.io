Hello, World! We are a group of reasearchers who are passionate about solving the challenges of autonomous navigation in dense spaces.
We believe, autonomous driving systems have the potential to transform cities planning and urban lifestyle.

### Why Automatica?

The current trend in electric autonomous vehicles design is based on pre-existing models of cities which have been built for cars, and the carbon footprint of cities cannot be sufficiently reduced until the overall requirement for vehicles is reduced, and more green and pedestrianized zones are created for better livability.  This is a major milestone in order to fulfill the EUâ€™s objective of reducing harmful gas emissions by 55% by 2030 as compared to 1990, with the vision of promoting smart cities where people and robots can interact in daily life. However, green and pedestrianized zones cannot be scaled in cities due to the lack of transport options for goods and people with reduced mobility. 

We propose to solve these problems jointly by providing autonomous mobility solutions for transport in shared spaces, which can provide green, accessible and safe transport to users. Such an autonomous mobility solution needs to be capable of operating in proximity with pedestrians, which makes this a much harder problem to solve as compared to traditional autonomous driving. 

### What we do?
Automatica Mobility is an autonomous shared mobility solutions startup with a focus on solving the autonomous driving problem in inner city environments where the space can be shared with pedestrians and vulnerable road users. Our goal is to develop software and technology that can be used to maneuver autonomous vehicles in dense shared spaces.
